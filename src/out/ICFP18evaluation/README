simply run ./run_exp.sh should start the experiment and generate plots

Note:

manuscript_fig contains the figures we used for submission. There is slight error in them, i.e. the LSTM used average loss per char instead of total loss per sequence

save_fig contains the figures/plots we generate using the script run_exp.sh

source files for the experiments are in evaluationRNN evaluationLSTM and evaluationTreeLSTM respectively

the plot.py handles plotting

check the run_exp.sh if you have questions about the script.
running TreeLSTM is slightly more complicated, because we need to download a big 2G data and assume some setup.
Details can be found in the run_exp.sh file.
